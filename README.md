# NFL-Analyzer
This program uses collector.py and gameLineCollector.py to scrape NFL data from pro-football-reference.com. It collects data such as scores, times, day of week, rivalry game information and betting lines. Once collected, DataParsing.py will organize the data and make graphs such as Home Field Advantages, Home Field Spread Advantages, Win Margin Frequency, Spread Win Percentage, and Rivalry Spread Margin Frequency. They can be seen below.
